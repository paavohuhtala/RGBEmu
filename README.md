# RGBEmu
An experimental cross-platform Game Boy (Color) emulator written in Rust.
Nothing works, it's not done yet, I'm not looking for collaborators at this time, etc.

* Code readability is the primary goal
  * No huge if chains / match expressions unless absolutely necessary
  * Enough abstraction to reduce code duplication
